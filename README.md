Hello, I'm @Jeomhps (/Ààd íiÀê.o äm.h…™ps/) ! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm glad to have you here.

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner exploring the vast world of IT. My curiosity drives me to continuously expand my skills across automation (DevOps), networking, and low-level programming (from C to assembly and network development).

## What I'm Learning

- **DevOps & Automation:** Currently diving deep into DevOps practices, focusing on automatisation and workflow optimization.
- **Networking:** Interested in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer networks.
- **Low-Level Programming:** Enjoy working with C, assembly, and network programming to understand how systems really work.

## Main Projects

I'm actively maintaining and developing projects that challenge me and showcase my interests:

- **datify:** A Typst package for formatting dates using locales not natively supported by Typst.
- **datify-core:** The backend API for datify, built on the cldr-json project, providing localized date formatting data.

These are my main focus, and I actively maintain them. Other projects in my repositories serve as showcases of my work in various domains and experiments.
