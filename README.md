Hello, I'm @Jeomhps (/Ààd íiÀê.o äm.h…™ps/) ! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm glad to have you here.

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic learner diving into the world of coding as a hobby.

## What I'm Learning

- Programming Languages: I enjoy experimenting with various languages, and I'm currently focusing on Typst, VBA, and I'd like to learn rust when I have some time.
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): Understanding the core concepts and their applications is my top priority. I believe that a solid foundation in DSA is crucial for efficient problem-solving and writing optimized code.

## Projects

I'm working on a variety of projects to apply what I've learned and to challenge myself. Here are a few highlights:

- Project 1: A Macro fuzzy finder for excel written in VBA.
- Project 2: A Typst package for displaying dates in languages other than the default supported ones.

Feel free to check out my repositories to see more of my work and my progress.
